# Student Life Department Management System

A React.js frontend application for managing members, officers, coordinators, clubs, and job alerts within a university's Student Life Department.

## Project Overview
The Student Life Department oversees all student clubs and activities.  
This web application serves as a centralized platform for managing:

- Members, officers, coordinators, and department head roles  
- Clubs, events, and student opportunities  
- Job alerts and notifications for members (planned in future versions)

This initial deliverable focuses on project setup, folder structure, routing, and backend-ready frontend architecture.
