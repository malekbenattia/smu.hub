Student Life Department Management System
A React.js frontend application for managing members, officers, coordinators, clubs and job alerts within a university's Student Life Department.  
This project is the initial setup and foundation for a full-stack web application.
 Project overview
The Student Life Department oversees all student clubs and activities.  
This web application will serve as a centralized platform for managing:
- Members, officers, coordinators, and department head roles.
- Clubs, events, and student opportunities.
- Job alerts and notifications for members (planned in future versions).

This initial deliverable focuses on project setup, folder structure, routing, and backend-ready frontend architecture.
